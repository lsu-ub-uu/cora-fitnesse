!1 Cora FitNesse Repository Overview

This repository hosts the FitNesse test suite and documentation for the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} system.  
It is designed to provide executable acceptance tests, system behavior documentation, and test organization for the Cora platform and its use in services like :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
