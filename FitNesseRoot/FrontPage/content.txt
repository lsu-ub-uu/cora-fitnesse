!1 Cora FitNesse
This repository hosts the FitNesse '''test suite''' and '''documentation''' for the Cora platform.
It is designed to provide executable acceptance tests and comprehensive system documentation.

!2 Purpose
The repository serves as both:
 * '''Living Documentation''' – Provides a readable specification of system behavior accessible to both developers and stakeholders.
 * '''Quality Assurance''' – Ensures consistency between the system implementation and the expected functionality.
 * '''Test Execution Platform''' – Enables direct execution of acceptance tests.

!3 Intention
The intention is to create pages that explain specific functions. Each page should describe the purpose of the function, define the acceptance criteria, and include tests for metadata definitions as well as tests for the function itself, covering all relevant actions.

!3 FitNesse Structure
 * '''CoraTests''' – Contains all documentation and tests.
 * '''DocumentationPage''' – Legacy documentation that will be integrated into '''!-CoraTests-!'''.
 * '''HelperPages''' – Helper and utility fixtures supporting common test tasks across the test suites.
