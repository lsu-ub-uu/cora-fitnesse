!2 Update
There are a few different cases for update that can happen, when there are write restrictions:

 * '''Case 1''': A user (fitnesseAdmin) has write permission on all restricted data, update all restricted record parts
 * A user (fitnesseUser) has write permission on some but not all restricted data, there are 3 subcases
   * '''Case 2''': A user only sends the record parts that it has write permissions for. Update the sent parts leaving the unsent parts, that the user does not have write access for, unchanged.
   * '''Case 3''': A user only sends the record parts that it has write permissions for and one of the record parts not sent is mandatory. Update the sent parts leaving the unsent parts, that the user does not have write access for, unchanged. No validation error should be thrown.
   * '''Case 4''': A user sends both record parts that it does NOT have write permissions for and part that it does. Update the sent parts that the user has permissions for, leaving the parts that the user does not have write permissions for unchanged.
   * '''Case 5''': A user does not send a mandatory record part that it has write permissions for. The update should fail with a validation error, as we are missing mandatory data in the update.
   * '''Case 6''': A user should have a list with write and read permissions. All write permissions implies read permissions. Permissions has to be equal to fitnesseUser permissions.
