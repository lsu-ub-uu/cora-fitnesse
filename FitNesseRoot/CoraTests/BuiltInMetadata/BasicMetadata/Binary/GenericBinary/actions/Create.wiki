!4 Create
It should be possible to create new binary records that are either unpublished or published. 
 * '''Case 1''': It should be possible to create an binary record with visibility set to '''unpublished'''.
 * '''Case 2''': It should be possible to create an binary record with visibility set to '''published'''.
 We check the following for all cases:
 * that the returned created data matches the data we sent to create
 * that the returned created data has the following actions: read, delete, index, upload '''Note!''' There is no update on a binary record until data has been uploaded as originalFileName and expectedFileSize only can be set when the binary record is created and does not exist for updated binaries.
 * that the timestamp tsVisibility is set when the record is created
 * that there is no information about different representations (master, thumbnail, medium, large, jp2) as no data has been uploaded against the binary yet.
