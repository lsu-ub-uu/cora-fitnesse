There four validation types of binaries:

 * '''!-ImageBinary-!''': All the binaries which are pictures.
 * '''!-SoundBinary-!''': All the binaries which are sound.
 * '''!-VideoBinary-!''': All the binaries which are videos.
 * '''!-DocumentBinary-!''': All the binaries which are documents.
 * '''!-TextBinary-!''': All the binaries which are documents.
 * '''!-CompressBinary-!''': All the binaries which are documents.
 * '''!-GenericBinary-!''': Includes all the binaries which are no included in the previous validation types. These binaries are generic and the system can not provide any specific information about them.
