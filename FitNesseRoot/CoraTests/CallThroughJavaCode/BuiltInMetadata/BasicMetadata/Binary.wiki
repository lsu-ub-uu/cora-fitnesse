The Binary record type is a fundamental component within the Cora system, serving as a reserved data structure specifically designed to manage binary data. This documentation outlines the purpose, structure, and management of Binary records in Cora. Binary records play a pivotal role in Cora, as they are exclusively designated to handle binary data. The contents of a Binary record may vary based on the type of binary data it represents. Different types of binary data may require distinct attributes or additional information. As a result, the Binary record is designed to dynamically accommodate the specific data and the specific data associated to the binary content. In summary, the Binary record type is a specialized and reserved entity within the Cora system, dedicated to efficiently managing binary data. By automatically storing essential resource information, it facilitates data integrity and accessibility. The flexibility of Binary records enables them to adapt to the unique attributes of various binary data types.
