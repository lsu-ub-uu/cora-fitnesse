 * '''!-VideoBinary!-''': All the binaries which are videos.
 * '''!-DocumentBinary!-''': All the binaries which are documents.
 * '''!-TextBinary!-''': All the binaries which are documents.
 * '''!-CompressBinary!-''': All the binaries which are documents.
 * '''!-GenericBinary!-''': Includes all the binaries which are no included in the previous validation types. These binaries are generic and the system can not provide any specific information about them.
