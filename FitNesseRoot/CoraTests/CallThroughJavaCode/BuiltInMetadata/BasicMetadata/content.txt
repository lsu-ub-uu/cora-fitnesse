!1 Basic metadata
Basic metadata makes sure that the basic metadata types used to construct recordTypes exists and works as expected.

These tests verifies the following for each basic metadata type:
 * the recordType exists
 * the metadataGroups defining new and update exists and contains the needed children
 * we can create, read, update and delete the record describing our metadata element
 * the functionality of the building block works. As an example, for a metadataTextVariable would we make sure that you only can use values that correspond to the regular expression, both when creating and updating a record that holds our example metadataTextVariable.
