!1 ID Generator
The Cora system supports three different types of ID generators.  
Each generator ensures that records can be uniquely identified, but they differ in how the ID is created.

!2 Types of ID Generators
 * '''User-supplied''' The ID is explicitly provided by the user when creating a record. This works like a normal data field and gives the user full control.
 * '''Timestamp''' The ID is automatically generated using a timestamp function. This ensures uniqueness without requiring user input.
 * '''Incremental''' The ID is generated sequentially, starting from a given number. Each new record increments the ID value by one.

!2 Tests
The following tests demonstrate the behavior of the built-in ID generators:
