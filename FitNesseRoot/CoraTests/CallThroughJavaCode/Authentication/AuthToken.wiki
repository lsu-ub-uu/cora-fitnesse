!1 AuthToken
The authToken is a secure key used to access the API after a successful login. When you log in to the system, the API generates and returns an authToken.

This token has a limited lifespan and must be renewed to remain active. The token's validity is managed by two timestamps:
 *'''validUntil''': This timestamp represents the session limit. The token must be renewed before this time expires, otherwise, it becomes invalid for renewal.
 *'''renewUntil''': This timestamp indicates the maximum allowable period for renewing the token. After this time is reached, the token cannot be renewed further, and a new token must be generated.
