!2 Password login

Password login makes possible to log in to Cora using username and password. This means it's possible to manage users who do not have access to shared login (SWAMID).

!3 Proposed solution:

 * Add the ability to set a password for the user.
  * Create metadata, for plaintext password (field for its last change), set recordPartPermission to write
  * Add fields for salt and hashed password, in its own recordType (see appTokens)
  * When the plaintext password field is filled in (new user, or during updating), on the server take the value, generate a salt and hash the password, save the salt and hashed password for the user, empty the plaintext password field.
 * Make it possible to log in (maybe in AppTokenVerifier (in which case, rename to loginVerifier))
 * Add a new recordType passwordLogin (child of login)
  * similar to ldap, but with user suffix instead of url

!3 Test cases
 * '''Case 1:''' It must be possible to log in with a username and password
 * '''Case 2:''' A user (outside SWAMID) without a password should not be able to log in
 * '''Case 3:''' It must be possible to set a password for a user and the user must be able to log in with that password
 * '''Case 4:''' It should be possible to change the password
  * It should be possible to log in with the new password
  * It should not be possible to log in with the old password
 * '''Case 5:''' It should be possible to remove a password
  * When a password is removed, a user can no longer log in
 * '''Case 6:''' The ability to manage passwords must be controlled by set rights
 * '''Case 7:''' A user marked as inactive should not be able to log in
 * '''Case 8:''' There are limits on how many login attempts are allowed
  * Five failed attempts are followed by a period of time when the login is unavailable for a user
 * '''Case 9:''' If you try to read a systemSecret, you get forbidden as a response
  * We grant full rights to systemSecret but still get forbidden
   * Applies to all actions
 * '''Case 10:''' Upon (creation, reading, ... all actions ) of systemSecret, the system should respond with Forbidden 403.
