When uploading binary files we need to validate that the integrity of the uploaded data. This can be done in different ways such as file size comparison and checksum checks.
#!include -seamless .CoraTests.CallThroughJavaCode.Data.Binary.BinaryDataIntegrityValidation

* '''Case 1:''' A binary is uploaded and the file size reported from archive does not match the expected file size from the request.
* '''Case 2:''' A binary is uploaded and the checksum reported from archive does not match the expected checksum from the request.
* '''Case 3:''' A binary is uploaded and the upload breaks halfway.

!3 File size validation
!***> '''Case 1''' The file size of the binary stored in the archive does not match the expected file size from the request.
