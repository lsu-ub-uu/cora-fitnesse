When uploading binary files we need to validate that the integrity of the uploaded data. This can be done in different ways such as file size comparison and checksum checks.
#!include -seamless .CoraTests.CallThroughJavaCode.Data.Binary.BinaryDataIntegrityValidation

 * '''Case 1:''' A binary is uploaded and the file size reported from archive does not match the expected file size from the request.
 * '''Case 2:''' A binary is uploaded and the checksum reported from archive does not match the expected checksum from the request.

!*< Define common variables
!define originalFileName {aText.txt}
!define expectedUploadResult {BAD_REQUEST}
!define expectedDownloadAnswer {An error has ocurred while downloading a resource: Could not download the stream because the binary does not have the requested representation. Type: binary, id: $tmpRecordId1 and representation: master}
!define expectedDownloadStatus {NOT_FOUND}
!define representation {master}
!define recordType {binary}
*!

!3 File size validation
!***> '''Case 1''' The file size of the binary stored in the archive does not match the expected file size from the request.
!*< definition
!define expectedFileSize {1234567890}
!define expectedUploadAnswer {An error has ocurred while uploading a resource: The file size verification of uploaded data failed: the actual value was: 28 but the expected value was: 1234567890.}
!define publishedBinary {!-{"name":"binary","children":[{"name":"recordInfo","children":[{"name":"dataDivider","children":[{"name":"linkedRecordType","value":"system"},{"name":"linkedRecordId","value":"systemOne"}]},{"name":"validationType","children":[{"name":"linkedRecordType","value":"validationType"},{"name":"linkedRecordId","value":"genericBinary"}]}]},{"name":"adminInfo","children":[{"name":"visibility","value":"published"}]},{"name":"originalFileName","value":"-!${originalFileName}!-"},{"name":"expectedFileSize","value":"-!${expectedFileSize}!-"}],"attributes":{"type":"generic"}}-!}
