!1 Binaries
Binary is a record type that contains information about binaries. See [[binary definition][<CoraTests.CallThroughJavaCode.BuiltInMetadata.BasicMetadata.Binary]].

'''Upload Resource File:'''
Users should have the capability to upload a resource file to any instance of the binary system.

'''Resource Analysis:'''
Upon successful upload, the binary system undertakes an analysis of the uploaded resource. The analysis focuses on extracting fundamental data, including but not limited to see [[binary definition][<CoraTests.CallThroughJavaCode.BuiltInMetadata.BasicMetadata.Binary]] :

 * File Size: Determining the size of the uploaded resource file.
 * Checksum: Calculating a checksum to verify the integrity of the resource.
 * Mime Type: Identifying the type of the resource based on its MIME type.

'''Processing Based on Mime Type:'''
The binary system processes the resource differently depending on its MIME type. Various actions are taken based on the identified MIME type to ensure appropriate handling and representation of the resource.

'''Representation Generation:'''
For certain MIME types, the binary system generates different representations of the resource. These representations may include:

 * Thumbnail: A smaller version of the resource suitable for preview.
 * Medium: An intermediate-sized representation for various use cases.
 * Large: A larger version of the resource, suitable for certain applications.
 * JP2: A representation in JPEG 2000 format.

'''Downloadable Representations:'''
All generated representations, including the original master representation, are made available for download. Users have the option to retrieve the master representation or any of the processed representations, facilitating flexibility in accessing and utilizing the resource in different contexts.

In summary, the binary system supports the upload and analysis of resource files, tailoring its processing based on MIME types. The generation of different representations ensures versatility, and users can conveniently download the representation that best suits their needs, whether it be the original master or one of the processed versions.
