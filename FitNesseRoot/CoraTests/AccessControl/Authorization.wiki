What an authenticated user in a Cora based system is allowed to do is built up through relations between some key concepts:

 * !-RecordType-!, the record type the current record belongs to and also settings for the specific recordType
   * public, if all data for the type is public to read or not
   * permissionUnit, if data is divided between different permission units to control update
   * visibility, if data is published or not
 * Action, the action the user is trying to perform such as CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
 * !-PermissionTerms-!, data collected from the current record and used to match rules and roles on
 * !-RecordParts-!,Â limitations on read and write on parts of a record
 * Rules, connects recordTypes, actions, permissionTerms and recordPartPermissions as a rule
 * Roles, connects different rules together as a role
 * User, has permission units permission has one or more roles, each role can get extra permissionTerms when connected to the user
