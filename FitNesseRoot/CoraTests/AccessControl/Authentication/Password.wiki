!1 Password login
Password login makes possible to log in to Cora using username and password. This means it's possible to manage users who do not have access to shared login (SWAMID).

!2 Proposed solution:
 * Add the ability to set a password for the user.
   * Create metadata, for plaintext password (field for its last change), set recordPartPermission to write
   * Add fields for salt and hashed password, in its own recordType (see appTokens)
   * When the plaintext password field is filled in (new user, or during updating), on the server take the value, generate a salt and hash the password, save the salt and hashed password for the user, empty the plaintext password field.
 * Make it possible to log in (maybe in AppTokenVerifier (in which case, rename to loginVerifier))
 * Add a new recordType passwordLogin (child of login)
   * similar to ldap, but with user suffix instead of url
